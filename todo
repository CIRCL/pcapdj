Some points that could be done on pcapdj ...

* read saved states and respect them during bootstrap
* add command line feature to reset all PCAPDJ keys in redis
* write easy to use importer program
* Use autoconf to build pcap dj
* write man page
* do more extensive tests -> (copy pcap data via pcap dj and compare etc)
